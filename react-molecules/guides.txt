<CssBaseline /> 

// You should place <CssBaseline /> once at the root level of your React project (App.tsx or index.tsx)
// It helps in:

// Eliminating inconsistencies across browsers by resetting or normalizing styles.
// Ensuring your app's design starts with a clean slate, following Material Design guidelines.
